The time and space complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray in an array of size n is O(n)
  because it requires a single pass through the array, updating a running sum and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

In contrast, the naive brute-force approach involves checking all possible subarrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2)
  and a space complexity of O(1). Therefore, the dynamic programming approach is more efficient than the naive approach in terms of both time and space complexity.
