//Analyze the time and space complexity of your implementation and compare it with the time and space complexity of a naive recursive implementation.

The time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm for the edit distance problem is O(m*n),
where m and n are the lengths of the two strings being compared. This is because we need to fill up a 2D matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1), 
and each cell takes constant time to compute.

The space complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm is also O(m*n), as we need to store the 2D matrix in memory. 
However, we can optimize the space complexity to O(n) by only storing two rows of the matrix at a time, 
and updating them iteratively as we move down the matrix.

In comparison, the time complexity of a naive recursive implementation would be exponential,
as we would need to explore all possible combinations of edits. The space complexity would also be exponential,
as each recursive call would add a new level to the call stack.

Therefore, the dynamic programming algorithm is much more efficient than 
a naive recursive implementation for the edit distance problem, both in terms of time and space complexity.
