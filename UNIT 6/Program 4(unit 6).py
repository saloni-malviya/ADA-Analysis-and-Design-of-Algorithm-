# To analyze the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm, we can compare its solution to the optimal solution. 
# Let C be the size of the set cover obtained by the greedy algorithm, and C* be the size of the optimal set cover.
# Then the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm is:
# approximation_ratio = C / C*
# It can be shown that the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm 
# is at most log(n), where n is the size of the universe. Therefore, the greedy
