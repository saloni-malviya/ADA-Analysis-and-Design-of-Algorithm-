"""
To evaluate the performance of a graph coloring algorithm, we can use benchmark instances that have been previously used in the literature.
These instances are usually publicly available and represent a range of problem sizes and characteristics.

One commonly used benchmark for the Graph Coloring Problem is the DIMACS Graph Coloring Challenge, 
which includes a set of benchmark instances of varying sizes and densities. Another benchmark is the Graph Coloring Instances Library (GCIL), 
which includes instances generated from real-world data, as well as synthetic instances.

To evaluate the performance of a simulated annealing algorithm, we can compare its results to the best-known solutions for each benchmark instance, 
as well as to the results obtained by other state-of-the-art algorithms.

We can also analyze the running time of the algorithm on each instance, and compare it to the running time of other algorithms.
It is important to note that simulated annealing is a randomized algorithm, so the running time may vary between different runs of the algorithm on the same instance.

In addition to benchmark instances, we can also use random graphs with different sizes and densities to test the performance of 
the algorithm under different conditions. This allows us to analyze the scalability of the algorithm and its ability to handle different types of graphs.
