"""
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approximation algorithm for the Vertex Cover Problem, 
we can use a variety of input graphs with different characteristics and sizes. 
We can use both real-world graphs and randomly generated graphs. 
Some examples of real-world graphs include social networks, road networks, and protein interaction networks.

To generate random graphs, we can use the Erdős-Rényi model, 
which is a well-known random graph model that generates graphs with a specified number of nodes and edges.
We can also use the Barabási-Albert model, which is another random graph model that generates graphs with a power-law degree distribution.

Once we have a set of input graphs, we can apply our approximation algorithm to each graph and compare 
the size of the computed vertex cover to the size of the optimal vertex cover.
We can also compare the running time of our algorithm to the running time of an exact algorithm, such as the brute-force algorithm.

To obtain statistically significant results, we can repeat the experiments multiple times with different random seeds and 
compute the average performance of our algorithm over all instances. 
We can also plot the results and analyze the trends to gain insights into the behavior of our algorithm under different conditions.
