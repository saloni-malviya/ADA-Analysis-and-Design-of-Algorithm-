""" 
Analyze its time and space complexity using Big-O notation.
The time complexity of this implementation is O(mn),
where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. 
This is because we fill in a two-dimensional array of size (m+1) x (n+1) in a nested loop. 
The space complexity is also O(mn) because we use this two-dimensional array to store the subproblem solutions.
In comparison, a brute-force approach to this problem would involve trying all possible 
subsequences of both input strings and checking if they match. 
This approach would have a time complexity of O(2^(m+n)) and a space complexity of O(m+n), 
which is much less efficient than the dynamic programming approach.
