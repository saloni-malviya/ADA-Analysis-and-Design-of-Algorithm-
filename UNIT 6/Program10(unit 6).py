# Develop a heuristic algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem, and compare its performance to that of the exact algorithm on a set of benchmark instances.
"""
Start
1. Initialize a set S to the set of all vertices in the graph.
2. While S is not empty:
a. Choose a vertex v in S.
b. Initialize a set C to {v}.
c. For each vertex u in S that is adjacent to v:
i. If C union {u} is a clique, add u to C.
d. If C is larger than the current maximum clique, update the maximum clique to C.
e. Remove v from S.
3. Return the maximum clique found.
End

"""
To compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem to that of the exact algorithm, 
we can use a set of benchmark instances and compare the running times and solutions obtained by both algorithms.

One popular benchmark set for this problem is the DIMACS clique benchmark set, 
which contains graphs of different sizes and densities along with the optimal clique sizes for each graph. 
We can use this set to compare the performance of the algorithms.

We can run both algorithms on each graph in the benchmark set and record the running times and solutions obtained by each algorithm. 
We can then compare the running times and solutions obtained by each algorithm to evaluate their performance.
