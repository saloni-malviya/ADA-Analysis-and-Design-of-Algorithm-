"""
To compare the performance of this heuristic algorithm to the exact algorithm, 
we can use a set of benchmark instances and compare the running time and solution quality of both algorithms. 
For example, we can use the DIMACS benchmarks, which are commonly used to test graph algorithms. 
We can compare the size of the largest clique found by both algorithms and the time taken to find the solution. 
If the heuristic algorithm finds a solution that is close to the optimal solution and takes much less time than the exact algorithm, 
then it can be considered an effective heuristic.
