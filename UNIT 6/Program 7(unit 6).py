"""
To analyze the expected running time of this algorithm, we can use a probabilistic analysis.
Let n be the number of nodes in the graph, and let k be the size of the optimal vertex cover.

The probability that a given node is in the vertex cover is k/n, since there are k nodes in the vertex cover and n nodes in total. 
Therefore, the probability that a given node is not in the vertex cover is 1 - k/n.

At each iteration of the loop, we select a node at random from the remaining nodes. 
The probability that we select a node that is not in the vertex cover is 1 - k/n. Therefore, 
the expected number of nodes we need to select before we find a node that is in the vertex cover is n/k.

We repeat this process until we have covered all the nodes in the graph. Since the expected number of nodes we need to select at each iteration is n/k, 
the total expected running time of the algorithm is O(n^2/k), assuming that selecting a random node and removing nodes from the list takes constant time.
