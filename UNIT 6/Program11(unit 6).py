"""
To analyze the time complexity more formally, we can consider the number of computations required for the algorithm. 
Each permutation requires n-1 additions, and there are n! permutations, so the total number of computations is (n-1) * n!.
Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * n!), which is clearly impractical for large values of n.
